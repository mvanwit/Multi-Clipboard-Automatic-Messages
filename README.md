# Multi-Clipboard Automatic Messages
 
Automate The Boring Stuff Chapter 6 Project

> _"If you’ve responded to a large number of emails with similar phrasing, you’ve probably had to do a lot of repetitive typing. Maybe you keep a text document with these phrases so you can easily copy and paste them using the clipboard. But your clipboard can only store one message at a time, which isn’t very convenient. Let’s make this process a bit easier with a program that stores multiple phrases."_

## Getting Started

For this project, you will need Python3 installed and the pyperclip module.

## Installing

```pip install pyperclip```

## Running the app

```mclip [keyphrase]```
